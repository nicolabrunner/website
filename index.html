      <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>My name is Nicola Brunner, I&#39;m 20 years old and I live in Riva San Vitale, near Mendrisio (Switzerland of course).

      <h2>Why Informatics?</h2>
        <p>I have chosen to study informatics, because it&#39;s something I am very interested in and where I see great opportunities
          for the future. In fact, my first idea was to study or to work with something related to the medias: photographer, cameraman,
          audio technician &#45; but I figured out that it&#39;s very difficult to find a job in this environment and so I decided to go for
          the informatic (but with the idea to utilize informatic for something related to the medias&#8230; finding a way to link them).</p>

      <h2>And before?</h2>
        <p>Before the university of Lugano, I have studied chemistry and biology at the Liceo di Mendrisio, I wasn&#39;t very good at the
          main subjects, but I compensated the bad notes with good notes that I obtained in other subjects, for example languages.</p>

      <h2>Languages?</h2>
        <p>I speak many languages &#45; slightly exaggerated &#45; but I speak very well Italian and German (also Swiss-German) and quite
          well French and English.</p>

      <h2>Experiences?</h2>
        <p>This year between my last school and the university I took a break and utilized the time for doing two Internships and for doing my
          obligatory time in the Swiss Army. I worked for a press agency based in Ticino for some months, as well as for an informatic company
          based in Zurich. Since January I serve at the Swiss Armed Forces, in the Rescue Troops as driver and in the last months I also had the
          possibility to promote as sergeant.</p>

      <h2>Hobbies?</h2>
        <p>As you can see in above presentation my hobbies are photography, videomaking and of course sport. I go often running and in wintertime
          I practices a lot of skiing.</p>
